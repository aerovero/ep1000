        <p> Assignment 1 is to create a website on Github to document the exercises and assignments for this module, EP1000.</p>
        <p> This assignment being the first time using HTML and CSS, the process of having a presentable website hosted on the internet is a long one.</p>
        <p> I'll be using Visual Studio Code for code writing and Github alongside Github Desktop to push commits and host the website.</p>

      <h2 style="padding-top:80px;">Exercise  1</h2>
      <p> Assignment 1 involved using raster tools to edit a raster image of myself in the "About Me" portion of the website using GIMP.<br></p>
      <h3> 1. Choose one of your selfies or photo and create an About Me page profile image.</h3>
      <p> That's rather self explainatory... onto the next step!</p>

      <h3>
        2. Remove the background of the image.
      </h3>
      <p>I tried a few ways to do this, such as Fuzzy Select, Layer Masks, Foreground Select and Free Select.<br></p>
      <p><br> Fuzzy Select wouldn't play well with the hair on the image, so after a few attempts, I decided to drop it.</p>
      <p> Layer Masks would result in patches of my skin being transparent due to the harsh lighting, the solution to remedying this is relatively complicated and I decided to leave this for the time being.<br></p>
      <p> Foreground Select/Free Select are relatively similar in that you mask out the area that you want selected before inverting the selection and deleting it. <br> I used the free selection tool as I was more confident in using it to capture the details around the hair in the image. 
          <br> Thus, this is the result!

      <h3> 3. Substitute with any scene or keep it transparent.</h3>
      <p> I decided to keep it transparent.</p>

      <h3>4. Resize to a width of 1280 pixels.</h3>
      <p> Using the "Scale Image" tool located in the "Image" tab of the toolbar, I am able to directly edit the width of the image while maintaining its original aspect ratio. </p>

      <h2 style="padding-top:80px;">Assignment 2</h2>
      <h3> 1. Create and design a logo or initial for yourself.</h3>
      <p> I'll be using a logo that I've been using for a while now. This file was originally created in raster a long time ago so I'm not sure where the original file is to show in detail how it was created. However, this file will be converted into a vector in this exercise. </p>
      <img src = "images/g19.png"alt = "g19.png" style="width:360px ">

      <h3>2. Trace the outline of the design to form a vector art </h3>
      <p> Due to the simple black and white nature of the logo, I am able to use the feature "Trace Bitmap" to have the software automatically vectorize the image for me.</p>
      <img src = "images/vector.png"alt = "vector.png" style="width:360px ">
      <p> It's also already in black and white, so I'm skipping Step 3.</p>

      <p><br> Here's the final vectorised logo!</p>
